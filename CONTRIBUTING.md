# Contribution Guide

## 1. Issues
Right now, I am the sole maintainer of this repository. Therefore, my maintaining the code and cooperating with your research requires a great time cost and a strong motivation. 

Simply put, there are five factors that motivate me,

1. `Purpose`: Personal development or Research or Product development. How much impact will solving this problem have on your efforts?
2. `What`: What events are occurring? What error logs are being displayed?
3. `How`: How did you attempt to solve the problem yourself?
4. `Why`: Why do you need this problem solved?
5. `Resources`: Material you have cited or referenced other than ONNX or JSON.

In other words, I am mainly interested in how interesting your project is to me and why you are in trouble and how big an impact it will have on your project. The issue template has all the required fields for the minimum information you want me to provide to motivate me. Please describe the information as politely and gentlemanly as possible without omission.

If you are unable to share the ONNX files owned by your project due to policy, you are still welcome to politely submit an issue and share only the ONNX files with me via email or other means.
